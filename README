This assignment was broken into 2 parts - WeatherPy & VactionPy

Both were made to challenge us on our ability to query APIs and use their data for various graphs & maps. Overall, I enjoyed practicing the creation of graphs with MatPlotLib. Clearly, creating scatter plots and regression analysis is very important for data analysis and I am excitied to do more of it!
