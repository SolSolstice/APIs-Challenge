This assignment was broken into 2 parts - WeatherPy & VactionPy

Both were made to challenge us on our ability to query APIs and use their data for various graphs & maps. 
Overall, I enjoyed practicing the creation of graphs with MatPlotLib. 
Creating scatter plots and regression analysis is very important for data analysis. Although tedious, I enjoyed creating and analyzing these graphs a good deal. 

I think I am forging a path in the right direction.
